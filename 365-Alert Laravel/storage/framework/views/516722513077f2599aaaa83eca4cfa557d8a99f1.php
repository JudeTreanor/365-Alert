            <p>
                <span>&#8722;</span> Turn off the electricity in all rooms that are at
                risk from flooding.<br>
                <span>&#8722;</span> Turn off your heating. In addition, you should
                interrupt the gas or oil supply. Make sure your
                oil tank is adequately secured.<br>
                <span>&#8722;</span> Pack up all important personal documents
                and records and store them outside the
                danger zone. You should also have a sleeping
                bag, rubber boots and a flashlight ready.
                Please don't forget your medication either.<br>
                <span>&#8722;</span> Charge your cell phone and (if available) a

                    <span>&#8722;</span> Never drive on flooded roads.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> Make sure you have followed the Orange -
                    Warning Level recommendations.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> If the power fails or is switched off, use
                    battery-operated devices such as your
                    smartphone or a battery-operated radio.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> If there is a risk of flooding, do not go into the
                    basement or the underground car park.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> Follow the instructions of the fire brigade and
                    the on-site helpers, have yourself evacuated
                    in good time so that you and the helpers do
                    not put yourself and the helpers in danger if
                    the flood situation suddenly worsens.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> Remain calm and act carefully. Rescuing
                    human beings takes precedence over the
                    preservation of property.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> Avoid bank areas and flooded streets and pay
                    attention to barriers.<br>
                    <span>&#8722;</span> Do not take a boat trip without taking all

                    <span>&#8722;</span> Please note that the fire brigade does not use
                    or provide pumps in flooded rooms during the
                    flood. Pumping out during the flood could
                    lead to different pressure ratios and damage
