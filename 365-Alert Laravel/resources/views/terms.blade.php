    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The flood information service is managed by the Environment Agency and will be referred to as ‘we’ from now on. The web pages and the services they operate will be referred to as ‘the site'.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Using the site</h2>
    <br>
    <p>You agree to use the site only for lawful purposes. You must also use it in a way that doesn’t infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of, the site by anyone else. <br> <br>

        We update the site all the time. We can change or remove content at any time without notice. <br> <br>

        Most content and data on the site is subject to Environment Agency copyright protection and is published under the Open Government Licence (OGL), unless we indicate otherwise. <br> <br>

        Our logo is exempt from the OGL, except when it forms an integral part of a document or dataset. <br> <br>

        If any content isn’t subject to Environment Agency copyright protection or published under the OGL, we’ll usually credit the author or copyright holder. <br> <br>

        You can reproduce content published on our pages under the OGL as long as you follow the conditions of the licence. <br> <br>

        Contact us if you want to reproduce a piece of content but aren’t sure if it’s covered by Environment Agency copyright or the OGL. <br> <br>

        We make most of the content on our pages available through feeds for other websites and applications to use. The websites and applications that use our feeds aren’t our products, and they might use versions of our content that have been edited and stored for later use (‘cached’). <br> <br>

        We don’t give any guarantees, conditions or warranties about the accuracy or completeness of any content used by these products. We’re not liable for any loss or damage that may come from your use of these products. <br> <br>

    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>Virus protection</h2>
    <br>
    <p>We make every effort to check and test our pages for viruses at every stage of production. You must make sure that the way you use our pages doesn’t expose you to the risk of viruses, malicious computer code or other forms of interference which can damage your computer system. <br>

        We’re not responsible for any loss, disruption or damage to your data or computer system that might happen when you use our content or data.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Governing law</h2>
    <br>
    <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. <br>

        Any dispute you have which relates to these terms and conditions, or your use of the site (whether it be contractual or non-contractual), will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <br>
    <p>We might decide not to exercise or enforce any right available to us under these terms and conditions. We can always decide to exercise or enforce that right at a later date. <br>

        Doing this once won’t mean we automatically waive the right on any other occasion. <br>

        If any of these terms and conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining terms and conditions will still apply.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>Use of long term flood risk information</h2>
    <br>
    <p>It is not possible to say for certain what the flood risk is at any specific place or time, but we use the best information available to provide an indication. We do this to help people and insurers make informed choices about living with or managing flood risk. <br>

        As our information relates to an area rather than a specific property, not all properties within that area (which could be a street or a postcode) will necessarily be at the same risk of flooding. This might be the case if the property is on higher land or the floor levels are high. <br>

        The flood information we provide is for sites in or near an area at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea and/or surface water. It does not cover other sources of flooding such as from local drains. However our records on historic flooding can include flooding from groundwater. <br>

        We log historic flooding where we have adequate records and do not have a record of all past flooding. If an area of land is shown outside the extent of recorded flooding it doesn't mean it has never flooded, simply that we don’t hold a record of the area of land being flooded. <br>

        Any information provided in respect of proposed improvements to flood defences or natural river channels should be considered as general information for the area in which your property/site is located. It is not specific to individual properties or sites.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>Flood map for planning</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The flood map for planning shows river and sea flooding data, ignoring the presence of defences. It doesn’t include other sources of flooding. It is only for use in development planning and flood risk assessments.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h2>Changes to these terms and conditions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Please check these terms and conditions regularly. We can update them at any time without notice. <br>

        You’ll agree to any changes if you continue to use the site after the terms and conditions have been updated.</p>
